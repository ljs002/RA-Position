**Research Assistant Application**

My name is Lindsey Smith, and I am a first year SILS student at UNC, but I am also a part of the dual-degree program in Public History from NCSU. I will receive my  MA in Public History in the summer. Through my coursework, I have learned some basic coding skills and am very interested in expanding my skillset in that area. Additionally, because of my background in Public History, I am very curious about how information science and information technology professionals can best serve the users of historical documents in archives, special collections, and on the web as items are increasingly digitized. My background in History is broad, with some training of the history of the West and the American Frontier as well as some training in Medieval history, particularly the history of Christian monasticism.

**Documents, Portfolios, Etc.**
My resume and a short list of projects I have worked on thus far can be found on <a href="http://www.unc.edu/~ljs002/">my website.</a>

I am very interested in this position and look forward to hearing from you!
